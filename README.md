Description Of App:
The RecipeManagerApp is an Android app that enables users to organize their recipes via an easy CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) framework. The application features three primary activities: MainActivity, AddEditRecipeActivity, and ViewRecipeActivity. In MainActivity, users can access either the Add/Edit Recipe or View Recipe functions. The Add/Edit Recipe feature enables users to enter information about a recipe, including its name, ingredients, directions, and category (such as dessert or main dish). When saved, the recipe is kept and shown in the View Recipe activity, allowing users to access extra details depending on the recipe's category (e.g., sweetness for desserts or prep time for main dishes). The application also enables users to remove a recipe, clearing the information and going back to the main screen.
